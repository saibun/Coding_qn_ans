# Given two integers a1 and a2, the first and second terms of an Arithmetic Series respectively, the problem is to find the nth term of the series. 
# Examples :
# Input : a1 = 2,  a2 = 3,  n = 4
# Output : 5
# Explanation : The series is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ....   , thus the 4th term is 5. 

# Input : a1 = 1, a2 = 3, n = 10
# Output : 19
# Explanation:  The series is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21..... Thus,10th term is 19.
def nthNumber(a1,a2,n):
    diff = abs(a1-a2)
    element = a2
    index = 3
    while(index<=n):
        element+=diff
        index+=1
    return element 

print(nthNumber(1,3,10))
